# Roles and Personas

ABD separates production from decision making.

## Core Personas

PO (Product Owner):
- defines business boundaries
- accepts scope and risk

BA (Behavior Analyst):
- defines behavior examples
- identifies edge cases

DEV:
- evaluates implementation feasibility
- proposes technical constraints

QA:
- defines evidence strategy
- evaluates risk and coverage

AGENT:
- produces structured output under rules

## Rule of Authority

Agents produce.
Humans decide.

Agents do not accept work.
Humans do.

This separation prevents silent failures.
