# Recycle Development

Recycle Development is the mechanism that prevents repeated agent mistakes.

## What Is Recycle

Recycle means:
- extracting lessons from every task
- feeding them back into the system

Recycle output is mandatory.

## Recycle Outputs

Each task must produce:

Kept:
- things that worked well

Reused:
- patterns to apply elsewhere

Banned:
- patterns that caused failure

## Where Recycle Lives

- Task page: immediate recycle notes
- Prompt library: promoted patterns
- Anti-pattern list: banned behaviors
- Changelog: major behavior changes

## Without Recycle

Without recycle:
- mistakes repeat
- prompt quality stagnates
- agent behavior degrades over time
