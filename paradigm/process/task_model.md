# Task Model

A task in ABD is a BEHAVIOR PACKET.

## Required Sections

- Goal
- Instructions
- Behavior specification
- Prompt specification
- Done checklist
- Review keynotes
- Touches
- Dependencies
- Recycle output

## Why This Matters

Tasks must be convertible to prompts.

If a task cannot be turned into a prompt,
it is underspecified.
