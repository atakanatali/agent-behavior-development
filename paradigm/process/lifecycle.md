# ABD Lifecycle

ABD operates on two levels:
- task level
- sprint level

Both are governed by behavior improvement.

## Task Lifecycle

Design
Run
Review
Patch
Promote

Skipping any step breaks the system.

## Sprint Lifecycle

Plan tasks as behavior packets
Run tasks with scorecards
Patch prompts during the sprint
Promote improvements
Retro focuses on behavior, not velocity
