# Prompt As Artifact

A prompt is a specification carrier.

## Properties of a Prompt Artifact

Every prompt must have:
- a clear role
- a clear goal
- strict input boundaries
- a fixed output format
- explicit guardrails
- stop conditions

A prompt without these properties is incomplete.

## Prompt Versioning

Prompt changes are behavior changes.

All shared prompts must:
- be versioned
- be reviewed
- have a reason
- show expected behavior improvement

## Prompt Ownership

Prompts belong to the system, not individuals.

Anyone may propose a change.
Promotion requires evidence.
