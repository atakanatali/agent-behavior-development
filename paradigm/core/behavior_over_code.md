# Behavior Over Code

Traditional development optimizes code.

ABD optimizes the system that produces code.

## Why Code Is Secondary

Code changes are local.
Behavior changes are global.

One prompt fix can improve:
- many tasks
- many features
- many agents

One code fix only fixes one place.

## Refactoring Target

In ABD, the primary refactoring targets are:
- prompts
- guardrails
- output formats
- review criteria
- stop conditions

Code refactoring still happens,
but it is not the first lever.

## Practical Implication

If a team says:
"The agent keeps doing X wrong"

ABD response is:
"Which rule allows the agent to do that?"

Not:
"Rewrite the output manually"
