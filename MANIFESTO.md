# Agent Behavior Development Manifesto

1) Development is the design and evolution of agent behavior.
2) Code is a byproduct, not the primary objective.
3) Prompts are first-class, versioned artifacts.
4) Behavior without evidence is invalid.
5) Agents must propose evidence before implementation.
6) Assumptions must be explicit and reviewable.
7) In uncertainty, agents ask questions and stop.
8) Output format violations are failures.
9) Every task must improve future agent behavior.
10) Recycle is mandatory; unrecycled work is unfinished.
